The scenario I worked around was an isolated team of people, such as a group in space or deep-sea exploration, with little medical training who were experiencing a medical emergency. Because of the isolation, they are not able to contact a human medical team in real-time. An agent therefore guides them through the medical emergency by calming everyone down and providing accurate steps that each team member can do regardless of medical competence. In order to accomplish this, we chose Situational Leadership (explained below) to guide the agent&rsquo;s speech so that the medical instructions were clear and easy to execute for anyone on the team.</p>

<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a dataset of speech and organized four annotators to categorize each line</li>
<li>Designed an experiment involving Likert-scale responses to a number of questions</li>
<li>Performed statistical analysis including: multiple linear regression, linear mixed-effects models, correlations, and ANOVAs in order to discover patterns and rules regarding how people perceive human speech</li>
<li>Used the analysis to design speech catered to four different kinds of leaders and followers</li>

<p>Humans are complex. Because of our diverse experiences and the other individual differences that make us who we are, we interpret the world differently. Two people may encounter the same experience but walk away with entirely different interpretations. When these experiences involve orders coming from one&rsquo;s boss and occur during a potentially stressful medical emergency, those varying interpretations can lead to very different behavior moving forward, and those behaviors can have serious impact on the health of whoever is injured.</p>
<p>In simple terms: it&rsquo;s important to understand how people will react to various kinds of speech when that speech is uttered by a boss in order to design speech that (1) people will be most receptive to and (2) will result in the best possible behavior from those people. This project involves exploring how people react to different kinds of speech and results in sets of linguistic rules for leaders wanting to reach different kinds of people.</p>
<p><strong>Situational Leadership</strong></p>
<p>Situational leadership describes four types of followers with varying degrees of willingness and competence that are then matched with four types of leaders with varying degrees of relationship and task behavior. For more info, check out the <a href="https://situational.com/situational-leadership/">situational leadership site</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/agentspeech/SL.png" alt="Situational Leadership"></p>
<p><strong>Creating and annotating the dataset</strong></p>
<p>I created a dataset from nurse and doctor speech in ER training videos as well as some past research. I broke the speech down into 294 full utterances, split whenever the speaker or situation changed (like before vs after a patient gets an IV). Those utterances were further divided into 375 smaller segments, each built around a single subject-verb pair.</p>
<p>Each string was tagged for its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mood-grammar">grammatical mood</a> (imperative, interrogative, or indicative), whether it was direct or indirect, and what kind of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254786679_The_DIT_taxanomy_for_functional_dialogue_markup">speech act</a> it was.</p>
<p>Four annotators were given definitions for task and relationship behavior, and they assigned a leadership style to each string. The strings were shuffled for every annotator so the order wouldn’t bias their choices.</p>
<p><strong>Agreement analysis</strong></p>
<p>Before analysing the annotated dataset, it was important to determine whether the annotators generally agreed on leadership style for each string. Again, the point with this piece of research was to identify speech characteristics that are understood by most people in the same way.</p>
<p>Overall agreement across the whole dataset was moderate (Fleiss’ kappa = 0.415, p &lt; 0.05, with 127 strings agreed on).</p>
<p><em>People find task-related cues easier to agree on than relationship-related ones:</em> When we grouped the data into low vs. high task behavior (directing/coaching vs. supporting/delegating leadership styles), agreement improved a lot (kappa = 0.570). But when grouped into low vs. high relationship behavior, agreement dropped (kappa = 0.362). This suggests</p>
<p>We then looked at speech features to see what drove consensus. Direct strings (where literal and implied meanings match) had more agreement (kappa = 0.377) than indirect ones (kappa = 0.193). The exception was coaching, where indirect phrasing, like asking a question but really giving an order, led to more confusion.</p>
<p>Grammatical mood also mattered. Imperatives with &ldquo;let&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;Let’s go&rdquo;) were more ambiguous than other imperatives (e.g., &ldquo;Go&rdquo;). Interrogatives (questions) weren’t agreed on much at all. The clearest agreement came with indicatives labeled as delegating leadership.</p>
<p>I also did some analysis on whether age or gender influenced the agreement results, but you can find those in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358411794_Designing_Speech_with_Computational_Linguistics_for_a_Virtual_Medical_Assistant_Using_Situational_Leadership">paper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Clustering to find speech patterns for each leadership style</strong></p>
<p>I narrowed the dataset down to the 127 strings where all four annotators agreed on leadership style. Each string was tagged with parts-of-speech (POS) using Stanford CoreNLP, then clustered two ways: with and without POS tags. For clustering, I used <em>k</em>-means with cosine similarity, basically treating each string as a vector of 0s and 1s depending on whether certain common words/phrases was present.</p>
<p>The goal was to see if agreed-upon strings formed clear patterns tied to specific leadership styles. I used the sum of squared differences (SSD) to find the optimal number of clusters, then grouped the strings with k-means. Each cluster’s dominant leadership style and its defining word/phrase patterns were then used to build rules for identifying leadership styles.</p>
<p>To find these patterns, I set rules for how long a word sequence had to be and how often it had to appear in the dataset. After clustering (see image below), I focused on clusters that were almost entirely made up of one leadership style.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/agentspeech/speech_clustering.png" alt="Results of clustering on 2-, 3-, and 4-word and -POS sequences that appeared 3+ or 7+ times in the dataset"></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The common sequences driving those cluster, and unique to that style, are listed below. Sometimes a POS pattern matched a specific set of raw words, so in those cases we listed the words directly instead of the tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/agentspeech/agentspeech_table.png" alt="Results of clustering on 2-, 3-, and 4-word and -POS sequences that appeared 3+ or 7+ times in the dataset"></p>
<p>MD PRP VB refers to a modal verb, a pronoun, and verb (&ldquo;Can you go&rdquo;). PRP MD VB therefore refers to something like &ldquo;You can go&rdquo;. VBZ IN PRP$ refers to a third-person verb, a preposition or subordinating conjunction, and a possessive pronoun (&ldquo;is in his&rdquo;). This sequence might appear when a leader is stating facts or verbalizing actions.</p>
