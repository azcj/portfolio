    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examined over 5 years' worth of daily French study data</li>
<li>Produced various graphs which illustrate interesting aspects of the data and allow for certain conclusions to be drawn</li>
<li>Final thoughts are at the bottom</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Growing up, I was terrible at learning foreign languages. I studied Spanish for 6 years in school but still managed to graduate high school without being able to speak at all. When I started learning French, I wanted to do things differently. So I decided to track every single thing I did, from flashcards, to reading restaurant menus, in order to stay on top of my progress and ensure that years didn&rsquo;t go by before I realized I couldn&rsquo;t use the language at all.</p>
<p>On February 12th, 2019, I booked my first lesson with a private teacher. This was my very first step. On November 9th, 2020, 637 days and 474 hours later, I passed a B2 mock test (a DELF test that places candidates at a high-conversational level).</p>
<p>In order to pass the DELF, you need to get a minimum of 50/100 and a minimum of 5/25 in each category. I scored a 72.5/100. My scores are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oral production: 18/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening comprehension: 16/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written comprehension: 20/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written production: 18.5/25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, after struggling to get back into regular French study, I sat and passed an official C1 exam (measuring work fluency) on June 7th, 2024 with a 72/100:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oral production: 19/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening comprehension: 17.5/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written comprehension: 17/25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written production: 18.5/25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking every minute I spent learning French paid off because it kept me focused and also helped me make some fun graphs.</p>
<p>The time I spent was split into 8 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Listening: any time spent listening to one or more people speaking French in real-time, such as meetings at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing: any time spent writing in French. This mostly included emails and writing exercises for class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading: any time spent reading French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media: any time spent consuming French media that included an audio component: mostly podcasts and YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular speaking: any time spent speaking to people in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language exchange: any time spent speaking to French people in a casual environment, either in a dedicated language exchange or during an informal lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lesson: any time spent in a French class. The vast majority of these were online, but some were in-person in group classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self study: any time spent studying on my own. Most of this time was spent making and studying flashcards as well as taking down notes from language exchanges and lessons.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>As usual, I created two graphics which summarize my zero-B2 experience and my B2-C1 experience (right-click on the images to view them in a new tab if they are too small).</p>

<p><em>The following text thoroughly explains my zero-B2 experiences.</em></p>
<p>This first graph below shows a stacked bar chart with everything I did on each day between February 12th, 2019 and November 9th, 2020. Note that all dates are in day-month-year format.</p>
<p><em>If any images are too small, right-click and open in a new tab to see the detail.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/french2.png" alt="Overview"></p>
<p>I made notes when I felt something that day was noteworthy. For example, on March 16th, after just 13 total hours of French learning, I had to buy a washing machine for my new apartment. It didn&rsquo;t take very long, and the salesperson was kind and patient, but it was a stressful situation regardless.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the breakdown of study time by month.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/french-by-month.png" alt="Overview by month"></p>
<p>From February to May 2019, my housing was very unstable - I was first living in an Airbnb in France before moving into an apartment in mid-March. In April and May, I went back to the US to officially apply for my visa, and I was essentially couch-surfing during that period. In July of both years, I took a vacation, hence the drop in study time for both. I seem to have been very motivated in March and April 2020 - likely following the publication of my second paper, meaning that I had hit my paper minimum for my PhD and I could dedicate a little more time to studying French.</p>
<p>The pie chart below shows the breakdown of my study time by category.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/french-by-category.png" alt="Overview by category"></p>
<p>During this time, the majority of my time was spent on self study and consuming media. You can see that reading and regular speaking make up the smallest categories in terms of time spent. I actually love to read in English, but I have a very hard time motivating myself to read in French (although I&rsquo;m working on that). Regular speaking is also quite small as I just didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to speak in French much at work. I did not feel my level was high enough to join any local clubs before the pandemic, and then of course that was impossible after March 2020.</p>
<p>The bar chart below shows the breakdown of my study time by weekday.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/french-weekday.png" alt="Overview by weekday"></p>
<p>Apparently I did the most study on Mondays, likely due to the fact that I barely studied on the weekends. The most common day for my lessons was Thursdays for a while, so no surprises there.</p>
<p>Finally, I created a histogram with the study time chunked into the nearest quarter-hour to examine the distribution of the 474 hours I spent studying.</p>
<p><img src="https://azcj.github.io/portfolio/images/french-histogram.png" alt="Histogram"></p>
<p>There were almost 150 days that I spent studying for less than 15 minutes, 28 of which were spent doing nothing at all. As I say in my comment, sometimes you just need a break. Days spent studying for an hour and a half or more are much fewer and farther between. Again, no surprises here. When you&rsquo;re doing a PhD, finding time for studying French can be tough!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at the data, I&rsquo;m surprised at truly how little I&rsquo;ve worked on French. When I started this project, I thought I&rsquo;d be studying for two hours every day minimum.</li>
<li>I did very, very little French reading overall and yet I scored the highest on the reading category than anything else. I&rsquo;m stumped.</li>
<li>Despite spending a lot of time consuming French audio in media and in listening in real life, listening comprehension was my lowest score. I remember when I was learning Spanish in school that this was also my weakest subject. Unfortunately, unlike reading or writing, not being able to understand much can hinder everything else. It&rsquo;s very difficult to have conversations when you don&rsquo;t understand what the other person is saying, so you end up having fewer of those conversations. Over a year later, I still feel that listening comprehension is by far the hardest part of French for me, even though I work at it a lot. I&rsquo;ve gotten feedback from multiple teachers that they are surprised that my comprehension is as bad as it is considering how much I work on it, so that could point to possible learning difficulty that is outside my control. It&rsquo;s a bummer, but I still try hard and do my best.</li>
